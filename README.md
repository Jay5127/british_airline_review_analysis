🚀 Successfully Completed Sentiment Analysis & Topic Modeling for British Airways Reviews! ✈️

As part of my internship, I worked on analyzing customer feedback for British Airways to extract meaningful insights from airline reviews.

🔍 Key Tasks Completed:
✅ Web Scraping: Collected airline reviews using BeautifulSoup.
✅ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Removed noise, stopwords, and irrelevant text.
✅ Sentiment Analysis: Classified reviews into positive and negative categories.
✅ Topic Modeling (LDA): Identified key themes in reviews.
✅ WordCloud & Data Visualization: Created pie charts, bar plots, and word clouds to highlight patterns.

This project helped me strengthen my skills in Natural Language Processing (NLP), data analysis, and visualization using Python libraries like NLTK, scikit-learn, Seaborn, and Matplotlib.

Excited to apply these insights in real-world projects! 🚀📊 #DataScience #NLP #SentimentAnalysis #Internship #MachineLearning
